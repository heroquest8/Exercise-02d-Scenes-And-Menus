# Project 02â€”2D Arcade Space Shooter

project for MSCH-C220 made 9/29/2024

at base it's a space shooter but i made it into a really really low quality version of shadow the hedgehog (2005)

## Implementation

Created using [Unity 2022.3.45f](https://unity.com)

Assets are all made by me (hero demaio) 

The explosion spritesheet was released into the public domain by [StumpyStrust](https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-sheet)

things added for points: bgm, handmade assets, background images, made a different kind of space shooter (space shooter turned shadow the hedgehog fighting g.u.n. soldiers and badniks)
